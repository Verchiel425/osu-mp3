# osu-mp3
Program to copy .mp3 and/or audio.ogg files from osu! Songs folder

HOW TO USE:
1) Assign a \Songs directory
 - can be done by either: linking your osu!.exe (in which case the program will \Songs folder inside the osu! root folder), or directly assign it by overriding.
2) Choose an extraction folder
 - this is where your .mp3 files will be extracted to
3) Hit "Extract MP3"

The program will automatically assign the names so you don't have to worry about having duplicate "audio.mp3" files
